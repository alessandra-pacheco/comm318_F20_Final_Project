## Presentation of my data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

#### Description of Project and Research Statement

__Project__: What are the costs to immigration enforcement and border security initiative along the Southwest border and its sectors?

The establishment of Customs and Border Patrol and controversial initiatives have never been as contested as they are today, as many immigration and border researchers believe it costs more to maintain border crossing sectors that their results. Specifically, they argue that border crossing/sectors established for the apprehension of illegal migrants, firearms, and drugs - and the cost fo staffing them- cost more than what they apprehend. Additionally, many immigration and border researchers, human rights activists and civil rights groups believe these initiatives don't actually deter illegal immigration, but force migrants to choose more dangerous paths in crossing the border, leading to more reported deaths and rescues.

__Research Statement__: Using CBP open data that details variable statistics ranging from migrant deaths, migrant detainments, drug and firearm apprehensions, to staffing (by fiscal year for all sectors including an aggregate account for the southwest border overall), and my own created border patrol budget tracker spreadsheet, I explore the trends over time of the various variables mentioned, to answer the following questions: 

   ___Apprehensions and Deaths___: Do DHS/CBP initiatives deter illegal immigration? Or do the initiatives just push migrants to choosing more hazardous crossing corridors that leads to higher death rates per fiscal year apprehension count? Are there sectors migrants favor more that are then targeted by initiatives that then push migrants to cross in other sectors?
        -More people crossing should be correlated with higher death count, but what if there is an increase in the migrant death rate but a decrease in apprehensions? This could mean that border crossing have become more dangerous overall 
    
   ___Budget___: What do the increases in the budget look like once these initiatives are implemented? How does this translate to changes in staffing? 

   ___Apprehensions and Deaths___: What's the breakdown of total apprehensions when it comes to family apprehensions, unaccompanied minors, and accompanied minors, and accompanied minors for each sector? What are the larger southwest border trends over fiscal years?

   ___Apprehensions and Deaths___: How has violence changed along the US-Mexico border per year? Are there more rescues due to claims in the first question?
    
   ___Drugs___: How have the amounts of drug seizures changed over time for the US-Mexico border?
